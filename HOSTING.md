# Hosting Guide: Pneumonia Detection Tool

This project consists of two parts that require different hosting environments due to the machine learning model's size.

## 1. Frontend (React/Vite) → **Vercel**

Vercel is the best choice for the frontend. 

### Steps:
1.  Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and log in with GitHub.
2.  Click **"New Project"** and import your `pneumonia-detection-` repository.
3.  **Crucial Step**: In the "Project Settings", find the **Root Directory** field and set it to `frontend`.
4.  The "Framework Preset" should automatically detect **Vite**.
5.  Click **Deploy**.

## 2. Backend (Flask/TensorFlow) → **Render.com** (Recommended)

Vercel has a 250MB limit for serverless functions. Since the VGG19 model is ~187MB and TensorFlow is ~500MB, the backend will **not** fit on Vercel. 

**Render.com** is a great free/low-cost alternative that supports long-running Python servers.

### Steps:
1.  Log in to [Render.com](https://render.com/).
2.  Click **"New"** → **"Web Service"**.
3.  Connect your GitHub repository.
4.  Settings:
    *   **Root Directory**: `backend`
    *   **Runtime**: `Python 3`
    *   **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    *   **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:app`
5.  Select the **"Starter"** plan (Machine learning usually needs at least 512MB-1GB RAM).

## 3. Connecting them together

Once your backend is live on Render, you will get a URL (e.g., `https://pneumonia-api.onrender.com`).

1.  Open `frontend/src/App.jsx`.
2.  Update the `fetch` URL in the `handleAnalyze` function:
    ```javascript
    // Change this line:
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5001/predict', { ... })
    
    // To your new live URL:
    const response = await fetch('https://your-api-name.onrender.com/predict', { ... })
    ```
3.  Commit and push this change to GitHub. Vercel will automatically redeploy the frontend.
