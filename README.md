# Pneumonia Detection Decision-Support Tool

An AI-powered chest X-ray analysis system built as a **Decision-Support Tool** for clinicians in areas with limited radiological expertise. The system uses a **VGG19** deep learning model trained via **Transfer Learning** on the Paul Mooney Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is a Decision-Support Tool. All results must be reviewed by a qualified medical professional before any clinical decision is made. This system does not replace professional radiological diagnosis.

## Phase 1 — Data Engineering

### Adult-Focused Dataset
- **Source**: [COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) (Adult-Focused)
- **Classes**: NORMAL / VIRAL PNEUMONIA (binary classification)
- **Splits**: Automatic 80/20 train-validation split

### Preprocessing
- **Standardization**: All images resized to **224×224 pixels**
- **Normalization**: Pixel intensity scaled to `[0, 1]`
- **Augmentation** (training only):
  - Rotation: ±15°
  - Zoom: 15%
  - Horizontal flip
  - Width/Height shift: 10%
  - Brightness variation: 80–120%

## Phase 2 — Comparative Study

### Architecture: VGG19 (Transfer Learning)
The model uses VGG19 pre-trained on ImageNet as a frozen feature extractor, with a custom classification head:

```
VGG19 Base (frozen) → GlobalAveragePooling2D → BatchNorm → Dense(512) → Dropout(0.5) → BatchNorm → Dense(256) → Dropout(0.3) → Dense(1, sigmoid)
```

### Configuration 1 — Baseline
- **Loss**: Standard Binary Cross-Entropy
- **Purpose**: Establish baseline performance without addressing class imbalance

### Configuration 2 — Optimized
- **Loss**: Class-Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy
- **Class Weights**: Computed using `sklearn.utils.class_weight.compute_class_weight('balanced')`
- **Purpose**: Address the data imbalance (the "data-driven mirror") in the Kaggle dataset

### Primary Metric: **Recall**
The system is optimized for **Recall** to ensure it minimizes false negatives — a missed pneumonia case is far more dangerous than a false alarm in a clinical setting.

## Phase 3 — Decision-Support Deployment

### Backend (Flask API)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

**Endpoints:**
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/` | Health check |
| `POST` | `/predict` | Upload X-ray image for analysis |
| `GET` | `/model-info` | Model metadata and configuration |

### Frontend (React.js)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend provides:
- Drag-and-drop X-ray image upload
- Real-time analysis with confidence scores
- Model metadata display
- Clinical disclaimer on every result

## Training on Kaggle

1. Create a new Kaggle Notebook
2. Add the dataset: [chest-xray-pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
3. Enable **GPU** accelerator (Tesla T4)
4. Copy the contents of `training/train_pneumonia_model.py` into notebook cells
5. Run all cells
6. Download `pneumonia_model.h5` and place it in `backend/models/`

## Industry Context

Existing AI-powered pneumonia detection systems have seen **limited deployment** in clinical settings, particularly in underserved regions. This project demonstrates the training and implementation of a practical Decision-Support Tool designed to bridge the gap in areas with limited access to radiological expertise.
